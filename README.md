# util-win
Text-based tools for the Windows Command Prompt (a-la util-linux). Written to mimic POSIX and Linux commands, but using native Win32 C++.

At least that's the goal anyways, this is a very rudimentary pet project at the moment, so it's not going to have too many applications or features. 
If you see this and wish to report bugs or contribute code, it would be highly appreciated!
